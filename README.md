**The Ultimate Discord Bot for Seamless Subscription Management with Stripe!**

This StripeCord bot is useful to make an easy free integration with those two platforms. It makes direct requests to Stripe API without fees. It's just as simple as you think! Customers only need to provide e-mail address they used in Stripe Subscriptions within a Discord Command and they get instant access. There is a function to check every X hours if all the subscriptions are active or not.

## TO-DO LIST

- Make some verifications if the user leave the Discord to don't make errors;
- Command to delete a user from the database;
- Command to force sync (execute the "daily-check").

If anyone would like to help the project, I would be grateful if you could make pull requests on what I still have pending, to enrich this project.

## Technical Requirements

## Acknowledgements

Core concept inspired by [Androz2091/stripe-discord-bot](https://github.com/Androz2091/stripe-discord-bot).

This version is a simplified version with JavaScript instead of TypeScript and it works with Mongo DB Atlas instead of PostGres to be ready to go!
